# Example: Include all .json files from a 'config_files' directory within the 'src' directory
# This path is relative to the setup.py location if package_dir={'': 'src'}
# For files inside the package defined by 'src', the path should reflect that.
# If 'src' contains package 'my_package', and config_files is in 'my_package', then:
# recursive-include src/my_package/config_files *.json
# If config_files is directly under src, and src is treated as a meta-package source:
recursive-include src/config_files *.json

# Example: If you want to include example data files from data/ directory
# when the package is installed (generally not recommended for large data,
# better to download or have user provide).
# recursive-include data *.csv

# Example: If you want to package dummy models/scalers (for testing/demo only)
# recursive-include models *.pth
# recursive-include models *.pkl
